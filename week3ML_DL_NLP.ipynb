The plot may be thin, the characters shallow and the acting majestically wooden, but director William Wyler really knew how to paint in the wide screen corners. The famous chariot race is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed.How big? Consider this - of the eleven Academy Awards won by this one, the Supporting Actor winner Hugh Griffith didn't even first appear until an hour and forty minutes into the movie, a time when most good movies have gone to bed.This movie really needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can put it on. The actors' nostril should be as big as hubcaps when they're shot in close-up. Even in its original 2:76-1 aspect ratio BEN-HUR loses a bit of its punch the smaller it's shown.\n",

I had to check it out for myself and watched it last night - some 4+ hours of material. The film - with and without commentary - plus over an hour of bonus video blogs. I've seen a lot of movies, but nothing quite like this. I'm still trying to absorb what I saw and heard. This is a keeper to watch again and again and well worth the price of admission. Act 1 is way-over-the-top-bizzaro-titillating comedy. I kept thinking - where is all this leading? Act 2 take an unexpectedly darker turn until the end. There's ample nudity - OK, more than ample. Someone ask Matt Riddlehoover if he did his own \"stunts\" and he said \"why, yes I did.\" I'd say this film is a must see to believe, but that's just my opinion.

Keep them happy, within the bounds of financial sanity, and the profits will follow naturally. A well-written book with lots of solid examples.

I will be interested to hear her follow up when it comes out, with her instant fame, she could greatly improve, or attempt to produce \"On How Life is, Volume II\"... I'll be waiting, n the meantime I'll be listening to Billie.\n",

Even then it was just stupid, a plane taking off gets hit by a mujahadine surface to air missile and then returns to its landing strip only to run into petrol drumms that lined the airstrip ! I mean really how lame. The fight sequence was poor, just all unrealistic situations. You can watch this once I guess, but then forget the 2 hours of your life you just wasted.

There are some good ideas but they're lost in a sea of shallow characters and needless ramblings. I won't give up on the author because when he hits he really hits. But I'm through with the Foundation series\n",

      "Review 95: If Only it Could Never End: While Ms. Horn has long been known as an inimitable master at squeezing emotions from well-selected lyrics, I find that this recording carries an even heavier emotional load than normal. Always taking ballads at a crawl--she seems to have slowed down even more on some of these tracks--if such a thing were possible. The singing is also somehow more raw--one hears the vulnerabilities of age slowing being etched into this heaven-sent voice. As I listened to the final, and title track, I broke down and wept, to contemplate that this angel's music will someday end. Only the truest of fans will likely grasp the full depth of this beautiful work.\n",

I mean, from the previews and such, I thought that \"The Pledge\" was going to be a really good movie. But now, when I saw it on DVD, I began to question myself as to why Jack Nicholson even bothered to make this movie. I haven't seen Nicholson ever since \"As Good As It Gets\" and really, I just have to say, \"Why, Jack?!\" I've seen better Jack Nicholson movies than this, such as \"As Good As It Gets\", \"Batman\", \"Wolf\", and \"The Crossing Guard\". But \"The Pledge\" has to be among the worst ones. And I really don't know what to say about Sean Penn's directing in this film right now. In conclusion, this movie may be great for renting, but it is not great to own, whether it's on video or DVD! And by the way, \"The Pledge\"? Looks more like \"The Plunge\" if you ask me.\n",

Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II.

Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious.

He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft.

For 7 dollars to buy, you cannot go wrong. If you enjoy games like Baulder's gate, Torment and neverwinter night, this game is a must have.

There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.\n",

I found his book engaging and engrossing and very annoying.I wanted to write him a disgruntled email asking him why he took me out of my pleasant suspension of disbelief by making me ask questions that the book had no answer to. Why does his character take only a toothbrush and have no clothes to change into? Why does he concentrate in minute and loving detail on Lisa Harper's clothes changes and forget that his hero is equally human and in need of clean clothes? Surely a hero who takes two showers in an eight hour period has some notions of human hygiene.Lee Childs notably has no long and gushing list of thanks and praise for everyone from his turtle to his manicurist, and I presume he has no editor either.

The songs themselves are great - interesting arrangements, tuneful, echo in the right places to give that mid-60s \"crunchy\" guitar and drums sound. The group only issued one more single after this before essentially breaking up. If you have an interest in UK 60s beat-orientated music that goes a little deeper than the usual suspects (early Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks - all fine groups by the way) you won't be disappointed in picking this up at the right price (under $10).\n",

I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'.

I also bought two packages of pillow cases, the comforter, two shams and a valance to match. What a big mistake. It was a total waste of money and I will never buy anything from Tommy Hilfiger again. The seams on the sheets (BOTH top and bottom) started unravelling after only THREE washes. The elastic on the bottom sheet came unsewn. I took the second set of sheets out thinking maybe it was just a freak thing that I got two bad sheets. The same thing happened with the second set. Also, the quilting on the comforter came completely unravelled after a couple weeks. The fabric of the sheets faded SO fast and they looked like I had had them for years. I will *never* spend my hard earned money on the Tommy Hilfiger brand name again. They are expensive to buy but are very cheaply made and fall apart right away. What a waste.\n",

Narrated by young Jim Hawkins, Treasure Island is nonstop fun.Jim is the son of innkeepers when a mean and nasty sailor (we soon learn he is a pirate) walks in and captures Jim's imagination. When the pirate dies (after two run-ins with pirates from his former ship that have tracked him down) Jim finds a treasure map and is chased by the same band of pirates. This leads Jim to take the map and with his allies attempt to track the treasure down. Complications arise including mutiny that force Jim to grow up and leads him to the adventure of a lifetime.This was a really fun book to read and is a true page turner throughout. Treasure Island gave us Long John Silver, Yo ho-ho and a bottle of rum, a talking parrot on a pirate's shoulder, pirates with a wooden leg, and a treasure map with an X.\n",

I study the occult and the occult references in the book were hazy at best, but that is acceptable since it is meant for mainstream consumption. What got to me most about this book is that there is almost no dialog, there are periods where there are three pages without dialog, without vaugely meaninful description (like say Moby Dick), but just pure nariation. The book is written from an omni-scentiant point of view, so it is hard to care very much about any one of the characters as a main character. Now perhaps it is acceptable for Clancy to have five main characters, when he writes a 900 page book, but this book being around 250, can't support the lack of focus.\n",

The only problem is that for the dvd I felt they should have inhanced the color/picture quality. Very faded, and warn looking. The extra feature is a George Pal short of John Henry and the Inky Poo. You can find George Pal on DVD on Amazon.com, and his Puppetoons.So in the long run I really enjoyed this stop frame animation film.\n",

You'll learn what the term \"bitch\" describes, as it's not what you're thinking. It is an assertive woman who has her own life, can take or leave her man, and stands up for herself. All the while, this \"bitch\" will love her man, and make him feel like a man, like he's in control. Of course we all know better. I recommend this book.

Others have already covered the synopsis, I just wanted to explain why I only gave it 4* instead of 5?Well..., I've been patiently waiting for Lance's second chance which he did get but--Carrie and Connors' story seemed to be more of the plot, then a subplot. I would have liked a lot more pages of Lance & Asia who didn't really get to work on their relationship until the last 80+ pages of the 291 page book and again the subplots take away some of those pages also. The only other reason is there are a few editing errors (a pet peeve of mine.)

The acting was fine, but Sandler and company really didn't have a lot to work with as far as a script was concerned, and the whole thing just comes off as pretentious and mired in its own self-importance.

The overall approach is more pop than rock. The opening \"Staying power\" is pop-disco with a pumping bass and some horns, and is kind of a declaration of what to expect this time from Queen. Regardless of musical style, Queen are so talented that they do it with class and quality whether it's heavy metal or pop. On this album John Deacon's bass plays a major role on the behalf on Bran May's guitar and even if I would prefer a more guitar oriented album, Freddy Mercury sings as good as always. The melody and the groove is usually there and songs like \"Back chat\" are very good indeed. But of course there's a couple of tunes I don't think stand up to former heights.

He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend. The only possible suspect seems to be a robot. The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human.As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts.

It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians. All have the added fascination of being written by an author who lived at the time or within a generation of those events, and read like newspaper accounts and editorials. Recommended.\n",

The theme of a man's need to believe in something resonates.But the plot goes in a different direction, much of it is about the angel. And the language is often harsh and the movie itself resembles The Pawnbroker in its cynical and harsh view of New York life at that time.Mostel is perfect, I believe every word and action of him. Belafonte would be a great choice as the angel if the plot eliminated the earthiness and self-pitying of his character and stressed the idea of him as an angel.

With that out of the way, let me say that this is one of the most underappreciated films of the 90's. Commercially unsuccessful, this should have gotten much more praise and location in '93 when it was first introduced. It's a movie about a kid who's torn between his loving father and the most respected hood in the neighborhood, Sonny.

      "Review 425: Heartwarming book: The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency is the delightful first story of Precious Ramotswe, a single woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency and is immediately besieged with calls for help. Precious helps a woman to find her husband, shows another that a man is really just after her money, and tries to determine if someone has been the victim of witchdoctors. Precious is a likable character, and I think it is her warmth that makes the book work so well. She was once, at a much younger age, the victim of bad judgment herself, when she got married too quickly to the wrong man. Precious now has the attentions of a few men who aren't so sure she should stay single.This is a fun, quick read - a delightful story.\n",

When I first saw the item, I thought there was a mistake, and I accidentally ordered a compilation CD, because the DVD is in a CD case. I was so disappointed, at the picture and sound quality!!!! It looked as if someone taped it from different sources (TV, Rhino Compilation VHS, etc.), and edited them, but in such a lousy way!!!! Many video's are cut in the end. The sequence is also horrible!!! Whenever you skip to go to another track you get half of the video from the previous track you skipped!!!! I am so certain I would have done such a better job taping the music video's from TV (i.e., VH1 Classics), editing them, and making them look more professional than this garbage!!!!\n",

In hindsight, the low cost should have been an indication about the quality of the writing, as the book was not really worth the $4,99 I spent! I was expecting a fun book focusing on her project, the challenges with cooking and other adventures that she had while cooking her way through a great cookbook, but I was sorely disappointed. The author went on and on about her personal life, her job at a government agency and her relationships with friends and family. It is more like a diary of the author's life with the cooking project being a side-note. I really would have enjoyed this book more if she simply wrote about the recipes and her experiences with them, than her life in general.\n",

Reapplication led to similar results. If you buy this, be prepared for frequent re-application at a high price. Rather than buying more, I will be trying the other Genie product mentioned by the other reviewer.Update 6/2012: Turns out the problem with my door was related to the design of the screw drive, not the lubrication. I have returned my review to 5-star. Per an Overhead Door repairman, my Genie/Overhead Door Screw Drive opener has a design flaw that creates a gap in the screw components when the parts are subject to cold temps.

The whole book is directed at the lowest common denominator. Style over substance.

They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, ¡quick and dark of face¡. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennie¡s weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars. In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events. Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time. Friendship will help you get through anything.\n",

      "Review 473: Bad surprise: I read the spanish version of this book. I was very surprised but in the wrong way. Patterson is very famous due his capacity to write best sellers. Apparently, the Alex Cross saga is his most affortunated serie. However, the book (in Spanish El lobo de Siberia) is full of clichés and resources recommended for apprentice writers only. Using the simile between one of the victims and Claudia Shiffer to give an idea of the character is over used. Same thing happens with the nick name of Dragons' killer to give us the image of Cross for the FBI people. Cross does not have a failure in any role of his life, this is unbelivable. Finally, I think that is a betray of the author to hidden information to justify the final and the openness to prepare a second part of this saga with the Wolf. I respect Mr. Patterson for his 80 millions dollar contracts, not per this book.\n",

While they do have 1 or 2 good songs such as \"Two in a Million\", is isn't enough to save the album. They suffer from the lack of unpredictablity and are on the verge of sounding juvenile (think Cleopatra). What perhaps is worse is the number of people in the group. 7 is way too many and considering that the guys hardly contribute towards the tracks (except for the occasional \"yeah\" and \"c'mon\") its a wonder they're still inside the group. Consistency is the key here and if they really want to attract a broader horizon of fans and listeners, they've got to do better than this.\n",

Instead it's about the protagonist's slow slip into obsession, to the point where he commits a moral crime himself in his monomaniac crusade.

It did feel bulky on the hip however the convience of just grabbing it and knowing you had everything from finger nail trimming to re-wiring the trailer lights covered was well worth it.Mine saw a lot of use in saltwater. Washing with freshwater and then oiling resulted in only superficial rust appearing. Unfortunately when I left that job I had to hand the knife in. Have looked very hard at the skeletor models but was after a saw. I then remembered how handy the scissors were and also that micro screw driver that I figured the extra weight can be saved eleswhere.So I have just ordered two more. One for me and one for dad.\n",

Now, it is a good, largely objective mag. As stated in prior reviews, there is some subjectivity; however, all car magazines I have read do have SOME objectivity -- we do want their opinions. They do test high-end autos (Porsche, Aston Martin, Ferrari, etc.); but, that probably comprises only 10% of their tests. If you really want to read about high-end cars, read Road and Track. Know that the 4 American car magazines prefer sporty driving and handling autos of all types. Generally, if the car is not reasonably quick and doesn't handle fast-paced or back-road (I do not mean off-road) driving well, it will lose points in a comparison.\n",

Hoping this new sequel would pick up where the movie \"Anne of Avolea\" left off, I was disappointed to watch and discover that the movie doesn't even show Anne and Gilbert together that often. The wedding that \"Anne\" fans have been waiting for was brief and rushed, lasting about two minutes of this three hour movie. After the wedding, the next scene the viewer sees is Gilbert going off to war. Honestly, I think my husband would like this movie more than I do given all of the war scenes. Though I enjoyed seeing the old cast reunited, I didn't feel that this movie was very true to the characters from the previous movies, and certainly not from the books. I plan to sit down and watch \"Anne of Green Gables\" and \"Anne of Avonlea\" all over again so that I may recapture the sweet romantic sentiment that this movie lacked.\n",

Unfortunately, this book just doesn't cut it as a biography. It's got some neat photos and the analysis of Bonham's playing and his drum setups are great, but the rest of the book is more like a high school term paper.

He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat.

The varied rhythms are layered with such delicate precision that I need a better sound system to truly appreciate all the nuances. A couple of the tracks had some silly \"lyrics\" that I felt marred an otherwise excellent mix by the Minimal Master.\n",

But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!\n",

To start off, the instructions are very vague, leaving you to figure out how to use the unit. The software, which basically performs all of your mapping functions, is spread out across 4 CDs with little direction, so again, you're on your own to try to figure out how to get a map and directions into your Palm Pilot and working with the GPS. And after waiting for 90 minutes for the unit to lock into a satellite, it never happened. Even standing out in the open with no obstacles. Plus the Palm processor is too slow to correctly run the maps. Save your money is my advice. I have already sent my unit back.\n",

This time, Archer falls in love and self-interest actually hinders him from being the moral center of the novel. What keeps the pace of the novel flowing is the theme of a man condemned by society and Archer's efforts to prove his innocence. There is also plenty of bloodshed, betrayals, and enough plot twists to keep the conclusion a surprise. In spite of the tragic turn the story takes there is the redemption for Archer who makes up for his own dreadful mistake in the past. It explains a great deal about Archer, his motivation and his maturity which grows in later Ross Macdonald novels.\n",

Disappointingly, I've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs. Peggy's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album, as her delivery can best be described as a neo-hillbilly twang. I may end up combining the best half-dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable \"best-of\" set, but I'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting. Only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set; more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of Pete's fine albums such as the Carnegie Hall classic.\n",

Youngblood contends that the events in the story are factual for the most part. But author Robin Moore is strangely silent. Moore never once claims that the book is non-fiction or is a biography. It is simply what Jack told him.The book reads like a teenage boy's fantasy, where Youngblood is a mixture between Han Solo and Indiana Jones, a rogue with a heart of gold. He can handle any gun and fly any plane. And all women love him, of course.Jack Youngblood is definitely a true character. But I believe that he is a bit prone to exaggaration. He reminds me a bit of the dad in the movie \"Big Fish\".If you would like to know more about Jack Youngblood, including links regarding his possible involvement in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, (...)\n",

Brokaw provides portraits of the war's various participants ranging from minorities, women factory workers, the famous and the ordinary. However, Brokaw just can't let his subjects speak for themselves. He interrupts each narrative to make sure the reader understands why this is the greatest generation. If you are interested in a narrative history of World War II with no opinions clumsily inserted, I highly recommend Studs Terkel's \"The Good War.\" Terkel demonstrates the incredible sacrifice and dedication of the WWII generation by picking a gamut of participants and lets their stories convince us that this was indeed a generation of heroes.\n",

While trying to be defiant and innovative, this film falls into historical incongruence. In order to sustain his picture of an eschizofrenic Joan Of Arc, Besson modifies or distorts historical facts and events already proven. For any person who knows and/or respects Joan Of Arc, or is looking to learn more about her, this is the last source they should look into. On another hand, the performances leave to much to desire, starting with Milla Jovovich, who overplays too offen. The only one who stood up to his name was Dustin Hoffman, a good actor in a bad role. To defy the common beliefs and standards in general, be it on Joan Of Arc or on any other subject, is always good, but only as long as such opinions are based on facts, something that Besson forgot in this movie.\n",

Now I prefer the finger down the throat, herion addited woman, however, it is nice to see some real, as created women (naked of course).Wonderful bodies, errie plot, nice camera work, overall a well rounded erotic horror movie. I hate spiders,this I freely admitt, however if like myself you are an aracnicphobic, don't let the spider scene scare you off. It has apbout 25 legs so it's not really a spider.

He is responsible for \"Omega Doom\" and \"Crazy Six\", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. \"Mean Guns\" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts.

His use of footnotes to make a joke that had no bearing upon the story was...lame, for lack of a better term.The jokes, reeked of \"ho ho ho see how clever I am!\" rather than actually being funny. The characters struck me as pale shadows of characters who only grow and change in set and sadly predictiable ways so that they can advance the plot and story rather than being changed by the plot and story.I can't even say the story was silly lame.

I came away with the feeling that there was no real plot to this book. My brother, who is a great Auel fan, called me (because I am a writer and have a doctorate in creative writing, and he is an engineer) to ask me what I thought of the book. When I told him that it seemed to lack a plot, he said in a very relieved tone, \"Well, I couldn't find one, but I thought maybe it was just me.\"I hope the next book, which I gather is the last and which is already somewhat overdue, is better than this.\n",

I feel for the trees that were wasted in the process of creating this horrendously boring soap opera in paperback. It is possible that I missed something while reading this work because I spent most of the time trying to stay awake. However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime \"soap\".

Although Gwyneth Paltrow received glowing reviews for this performance, and is doing what I'm sure is a wonderful acting job, the character she plays (Catherine) was so irritating to me that I found it difficult to watch. I didn't feel sympathy for her, as I should have, and I couldn't see how Hal could be attracted to her. Perhaps part of this was due to the mechanism of jumping back and forth in time--maybe I couldn't get a complete picture of who Catherine was. I only saw her as self-absorbed, foul-mouthed and ready to spurn any kindness offered her. She appeared to be more of an adolescent--in her behavior and her way of whining when she spoke--than a 27 year old. Also, I wanted more of the intrigue of those who have a passion for math, but that was missing in this film.\n",

These lectures are very hard to understand. Partly the lectures, prepared in early 1960s, suffer from being rather dated.

Once a masterpiece of film, every frame worthy of a spot in the Louvre, is now just another... war movie. What a shame.\n",

I even had low expectations going into this. A horror movie about monsters in a cave. Geez, there's an original idea. Anyways, maybe it's because it was all about women only that women reviewers are giving it such high remarks. I don't know. Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring.\n",

Convenience wise, the only complaints are very minor. It does cool VERY quickly when you remove the lid, so you must be prepared and work quickly.

Though fans of Surprise, Surprise, Surprise may feel a little left out since these songs lack the darkness found in the previous albums, Mark's sonngwriting has only grown stronger. Perhaps the production is to blame for the lighter feel of these sonngs. Not to say it is at all bad, the glossy production gives new light to instruments that often were lost in the mix on their earlier albums. So while it feels these songs dont have the depth that their earlier work has, it is only because there is greater focus.\n",

The movie goes into unbelievable mode far too quick, plus it has a tough time retaining your attention.For the record, I am not an outright critic of SciFi.

Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course.\n",

I really enjoy Codrescu's essays on NPR, especially when they touch on topics pertaining to New Orleans, where I lived for five years. I also thought the subject matter had some potential. Unfortunately, he is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of his fellow New Orleanian, Anne Rice. The portrayal of the countess is really unconvincing. She wants eternal youth. Ok, so? She comes across as about as complex as the evil queen in Disney's Snow White. The \"present day\" subplot makes the game, Clue, seem like an Umberto Eco masterpiece of intricacy. For readers who want a complex representation of a reprehensible villain of the middle ages, go to Joris Karl Huysmans' La Bas for his depiction of Gilles de Rais, who made the Marquis de Sade look like a neophyte. Codrescu should stick to what he does best - write clever essays for NPR. He's no great shakes as a novelist.\n",

If you haven't seen it yet I'd say your missing a very good movie.And the price was just out of this world, you can't beat [..]every where that I have looked the price is over [..]. So thank you.Thank YouDebbie Quintanarquinnabe@sbcglobal.net\n",

      "Review 997: Worst Ever: This was the worst book I have ever read. There is absolutely no comparison to Harry Potter. The story is about a girl who finds a book in the library called \" So You Want to Be a Wizard.\" She soon meets another young wizard in training and together they battle some dark forces. I thought this book sounded really good, so I bought it, but this book is boring, and not at all interesting.It is not creative and some parts in the plot are quite predictable. I do not reccommend it.\n",

      "Review 999: Holy Moly! It didn't suck as bad as I had anticipated.: Alright. My wife picked this out at the video store, and I failed to look to see what it was. We pop it in the old DVD player and out comes this crazy, Japanese, shot with a home video camera laiden, tv show. My first reaction was, \"There is no way I am going to make it through this (...)\" So, I sat and watched for a bit longer. The main characters show up and the horrific acting begins. From the get-go you can pick out who is going to win, who is going to die, and even who the crazy one is. Enter the \"slashers.\" I have to say that the \"slashers\" are the only reason I kept watching. After the movie ended, I was sitting there astonished at how much I liked it. I tried to hate it, however, couldn't help but like it. The thought has actually crossed my mind about buying the title. At least rent it and give it a shot.\n",

      "Review 1000: Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a \"strobe\" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck.\n",
